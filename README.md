# Dye Plant Lessons
Teaching materials on use of vegitable dyes on "natural" (ie. protein, cellulose) fiber

#### Might be subtitled 
- Dye plants in the kitchen
- How to use vegitable dyes and not to poison your family
- Vegitable dyes and why I hate the ter "natural dyes"

This is an on-going project. Materials updated as needed.

#### Document formats
Some Acrobat Pdfs, Microsoft doc and LiberOffice format.  I do a lot of my own work on a Linux machine so I use LiberOffice since that can read MS Word, MS Excel as well as it's own format.  Presentations don't move back and forth between operating systems so I'm moving to replacing all presentations with markdown slides.

#### Zenoto link
